    "\n",
    "Chat-bots are becoming more and more useful in various simple professional tasks as they get more and more able to capture the essence of communicating with people. Still the development of good chat-bots that will answer more complicated questions, in general subjects, is a growing domain of research. The goal of this project is to create a chatbot able to answer python related questions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our project started with the main idea being that a programming assistant would be a much needed help by many people working or studying computer science. Although it sounds simple it soon proved to be a difficult task. The main challenge is that the model has to extract a technical correlation between Questions and Answers in order to be able to communicate effectively. The model that we used in order to achieve our goal is a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model. The main steps that we followed are described bellow:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  We found, downloaded, and processed data taken from stack overflow concerning questions that contained at least one python tag. (https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions)\n",
    "-  Implement a sequence-to-sequence model.\n",
    "-  Jointly train encoder and decoder models using mini-batches\n",
    "-  Used greedy-search decoding\n",
    "-  Interact with trained chatbot\n",

We decided to proceed with the last step as soon as we saw that including code blocks in the training provess would be an extremely difficult task as it would demand exceptional handling of the data.

    "if we rely solely on the context vector to encode the entire input\n",
    "sequence’s meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss.\n",
    "This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences,\n",

    "\n",
    "To combat this, `Bahdanau et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__\n",
